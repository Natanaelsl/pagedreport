```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

## Principle

The package `pagedreport` offer custom templates to make the use of `pagedown` easier. All of the customization goes through the YAML header of the template.

## How it works

As an example, here is the YAML header for a special Christmas template made with `pagedreport::paged_hazelnuts`.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28248895/102329258-7a023800-3f88-11eb-8f4c-2f6c0cb9b562.png")
```

```{yaml, eval = FALSE}

title: "Annual North"
subtitle: "Christmas activity report"
author: "Santa Claus"
date: "December 2020"
output:
  pagedreport::paged_hazelnuts:
    front_img: "https://images.pexels.com/photos/717988/pexels-photo-717988.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=750&w=1260"
    back_img: "https://images.pexels.com/photos/3303615/pexels-photo-3303615.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=1&w=500"
    logo: "https://www.flaticon.com/svg/static/icons/svg/268/268225.svg"
    img_to_dark: TRUE
    logo_to_white: TRUE
knit: pagedown::chrome_print
toc-title: "Table of Contents"
main-color: "#E40A2D"
secondary-color: "#00873E"
google-font: true
common-font: "Raleway"
top-font: "Mountains of Christmas"
---
```

As you can see, four blocks can be distinguised :

+ the first one is pretty classical with `title`, `subtitle`, `author` and `date` ;

+ the second one is about the template to use and his arguments. All the arguments related to images and logo are in this block ;

+ the third one is `knit: pagedown::chrome_print` to get the PDF output ;

+ the last one is about customization of the template through some arguments like `main-color` or `top-font`. This part is handled through a custom Pandoc template and some JavaScript functions to update the CSS.

## Custom elements

For all the templates, you can change the main color and the fonts using `main-color`, `common-font` or `top-font` in the header.

For the fonts, if you have it installed, just delete the `google-font: true` line. Otherwise, leave it as it is to use Google Fonts by their names.

Templates have also differents arguments.

### `paged_windmill`

Here you can use a logo and a front image with the `logo` and `img` arguments of the `paged_windmill` function.

If you want to darken the image, use `img_to_dark: TRUE` and `logo_to_white: TRUE` to transform your logo in a white version.

### `paged_grid`

This template use no image, but only a logo. 

### `paged_hazelnuts`

This one is the most complex, with a table of contents included. You also have a front image with `front_img` and a back image with `back_img` arguments.
