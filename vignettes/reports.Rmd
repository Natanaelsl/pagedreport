## Introduction

The `pagedreport` package offers a set of custom RMarkdown templates to make attractive PDF reports. These templates can also be customized to match your organization's branding, including colors, fonts, and a logo. All customization takes place in the YAML header of the template, meaning you never have to mess with HTML or CSS. Everything you need to do in order to make beautiful reports happens right in R. 

## How it Work

As an example, here is the YAML header for a special Christmas template made with `pagedreport::paged_hazelnuts`.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28248895/102329258-7a023800-3f88-11eb-8f4c-2f6c0cb9b562.png")
```

```{yaml, eval = FALSE}

subtitle: "Christmas activity report"

    back_img: "https://images.pexels.com/photos/3303615/pexels-photo-3303615.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=1&w=500"
    logo: "https://www.flaticon.com/svg/static/icons/svg/268/268225.svg"
    img_to_dark: TRUE
    logo_to_white: TRUE
knit: pagedown::chrome_print
toc-title: "Table of Contents"
main-color: "#E40A2D"
secondary-color: "#00873E"
google-font: TRUE
common-font: "Raleway"
top-font: "Mountains of Christmas"

```

The YAML has four main sections

+ The first section (`title`, `subtitle`, `author` and `date`) includes arguments that will be familiar to all RMarkdown users. 

+ The second sections selects the template to use and relevant arguments. All arguments related to images (e.g. images on the front and back cover) and logo are in this section 

+ The third section is `knit: pagedown::chrome_print`, which is [how we get our PDF output](https://pagedown.rbind.io/#print-to-pdf). 

+ The last section provides several arguments to customize colors and fonts. 

## Customization

For all the templates, you can change the colors and the fonts using `main-color`, `secondary-color`, which do what they say on the tin. 

The `google-font` argument, if set to TRUE, enables you to use any font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) (if you set `google-font` to FALSE, you can also use fonts you have on your local computer). The `common-font` argument sets the font for elements such as paragraph text. The `top-font` argument sets the font for headers. 

The three templates have also have unique arguments, outlined below.

### `paged_windmill`

Here you can use a logo and a cover image with the `logo` and `img` arguments of the `paged_windmill` function.

If you want to darken the image, use `img_to_dark: TRUE`. [This will help make the text on top of it easier to read](https://twitter.com/steveschoger/status/888021897782362114). 

You can also  `logo_to_white: TRUE` to transform your logo into a white version. This is helpful if the cover image is dark and you want to make sure your logo is visible. 

### `paged_grid`

This template uses a logo using the `logo` argument, but does not have a cover image so `img` is unnecessary. 

### `paged_hazelnuts`

This template is the most complex of three. In addition to setting the cover image with `front_img`, you can also set an image to go on the back cover the with `back_img` argument. This template also has a table of contents included, which can be disabled using the `toc` argument under output.
