# Parâmetro e Premissas {-}

As projeções das receitas foram efetuadas com base nos valores passados das séries em análise e, portanto, admitindo-se a premissa básica de que o comportamento passado serve para determinar o comportamento futuro, ou seja, supõe-se que as trajetórias detectadas provavelmente vão continuar a acontecer nos períodos seguintes.

Vale salientar, também, que comportamentos irregulares detectados nos históricos das séries podem afetar negativamente a qualidade das projeções. Fatores e choques exógenos são, via de regra, difíceis de modelar, mas devem ser levados em consideração quando possível.

Deve-se, ainda, dar ênfase ao fato de que as previsões são efetuadas para um período muito longo, o que amplifica erros de previsão. Portanto, os resultados devem ser considerados com essa importante ressalva.

## ICMS {-}

O ICMS é a principal fonte de receita do Estado de Goiás, sendo o maior e mais importante imposto de competência estadual. Por ser cobrado na circulação de mercadorias, sobre o valor a elas agregado, depende significativamente da atividade econômica estadual e brasileira.

This file is what a user will see when they select your template. Make sure that you update the fields in the yaml header. In particular you will want to update the `output` field to whatever format your template requires.
This is a good place to demonstrate special features that your template provides. Ideally it should knit out-of-the-box, or at least contain clear instructions as to what needs changing.
